                            My name is Ayilara Boluwatife John but always called Jaystar by my friends, sorry for my informlity if it seems odd to you. <span>&#128534;</span> i just think that its good to have fun while doing what you're passionate about and i will call that Programming. I'm an undergraduate in LADOKE AKINTOLA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY presently and in 400level, second semester.

                            If you call me a young programmer, i see nothing bad in that, because that's a bit true, though have been coding for the past 3-4 years now. The funniest part is that i went through the hard way at first <span>&#128531;</span> but now, i'm proud of what have acquired so far. <span>&#128516;</span>. What have learnt along my programming journey is that learning never stops only you can stop learning either for good or the opposite, and i can say that only consistency can keep you moving on. I don't want to bored you with my chit-chat but i see learning as a journey that never ends. No matter how little, we have to learn per day <span>&#128534;</span>.
